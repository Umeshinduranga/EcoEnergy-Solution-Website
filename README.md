# EcoEnergy Website Project

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework for the Web Development module (1st year, 2nd semester) at IIT, developed in collaboration with the University of Westminster, UK.
The repository contains the source code for the EcoEnergy website, a web development coursework project focused on promoting renewable energy solutions. The site showcases information about sustainable energy, including home, table, and content pages, designed with a focus on accessibility, usability, and modern web standards. The project was developed by a team of students, with Student 2 (W.P.U. Induranga) contributing to the home, table, and content pages.

## Project Structure
The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3, with a consistent design across pages. Key files and directories include:

- **/Pages/**: Contains HTML files for the main pages:
  - `home.html`: The homepage introducing EcoEnergy Solutions with a hero banner and renewable energy facts.
  - `table.html`: Displays renewable energy production trends and predictions in a tabular format.
  - `content.html`: Provides detailed information on wind energy, including technology and future potential.
  - `pageEditor_ST2.html`: Documents the technical and accessibility details of the developed pages.
  - `validation_ST2.html`: Contains validation reports for the implemented pages.

- **/CSS/**: Includes stylesheets:
  - `globle.css`: Global styles for consistent design.
  - `homestyles.css`, `tablestyles.css`, `contentstyles.css`, `pageEditor_validator.css`: Page-specific styles.

- **/images/**: Stores images used across the site (e.g., banners, icons, wind turbines).
- **/icons/**: Contains icons for table headers and quick facts.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5**: Ensures clear structure and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast colors, semantic tags, and ARIA labels support screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Interactive Elements**: Tooltips, hover effects, and a sticky sidebar enhance user experience.
- **Validation**: Pages comply with W3C standards, validated using the Nu HTML Checker.

## Pages Developed by Student 2

### Home Page
- **Description**: Introduces EcoEnergy Solutions with a hero banner, renewable energy facts, and a call-to-action for volunteering.
- **Technical Highlights**: Uses semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`), sticky navigation, and overlapping images for visual appeal.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast text, legible font sizes, and alt text for images.

### Table Page
- **Description**: Presents renewable energy production trends and predictions for various countries in a styled table.
- **Technical Highlights**: Features a responsive table with tooltips, animations, and a modern design using CSS (border-radius, box-shadow).
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA labels, high-contrast text, and mobile-friendly scrolling.

### Content Page
- **Description**: Explores wind energy in-depth, covering its overview, current state, technology, benefits, challenges, and future potential.
- **Technical Highlights**: Uses a fixed sidebar for navigation, centralized content, and image containers with box shadows.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic navigation, keyboard-friendly links, and descriptive alt text.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Umeshinduranga/ecoenergy-website.git
```

2. Open the project in a web browser:
   - Navigate to the Pages folder and open home.html to view the homepage.
   - Alternatively, use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for a better experience.

3. Ensure an internet connection for external resources (e.g., Google fonts, Font Awesome).

## Usage
- Browse the website starting from home.html to explore renewable energy content.
- Use the navigation bar to access other pages (table.html, content.html).
- Check pageEditor_ST2.html for technical details and validation_ST2.html for validation reports.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
- **Challenge**: Maintaining a consistent black and purple theme across pages due to team coordination issues.
- **Solution**: Implemented a shared globle.css file and held weekly syncs for alignment.
- **Lesson**: Effective communication and version control are essential for collaborative projects.

## Compliance
- **Standards**: Pages adhere to JISC regulations and WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines.
- **Validation**: Validated using the Nu HTML Checker.
- **Assets**: Royalty-free images sourced from iStockPhoto with proper attribution.
